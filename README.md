# Lighthouse Labs | Custom Hooks

* [ ] What are Custom Hooks?
* [ ] Example Custom Hooks!

## What is a React Hook?

A function that lets us use React features!

* `useState`
* `useReducer`

Custom Hooks
> Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

Rules when using hooks...
* They are functions
* Their names always start with `use`
* These should only be used in the "top-level" of components
* The goal of "custom hooks" is to pull repetitive or complex code out of our component and place it in a function/hook

## [X] 1. "Toggle Hook" -> We want a re-usable state that can easily turn a value on/off || true/false.

1. Make a component that can successfully toggle something...
2. Refactor that functionality to exist in a custom hook.

## [ ] 2. "Update Page Title Hook" -> We want to change the document title.
