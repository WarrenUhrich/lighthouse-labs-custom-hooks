[X] Didn't we already learn about hooks?
[X] Why custom hooks?
[X] Demonstrations

## React Hooks
- `useState` (managing data that may change)
- `useEffect` (side effects that occur on data change or initial load of component)

## Custom Hooks
We can break out our business logic from our component, reducing bloat in component and giving us a way to re-use functionality from component to component.

Note how much smaller are components become as we break out complex pieces into separate hooks. They get to be separate, specialized, and it gives us the opportunity to make much of our code more re-usable!
