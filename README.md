[ ] Demonstrations

## React Hooks
- `useState` (managing data that may change)
- `useEffect` (side effects that occur on data change or initial load)

## Custom Hooks
We can break out our business logic from our component, reducing bloat in component and giving us a way to re-use functionality from component to component.
